In fact , this was not a Nicoise salad and was barely eatable .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
While there 's a decent menu , it should n't take ten minutes to get your drinks and 45 for a dessert pizza .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O

The menu is interesting and quite reasonably priced .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O
The food was delicious and clearly fresh ingredients were used .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O

This particular location certainly uses substandard meats .	O O O O O O B-AS O
I stumbled upon this resteraunt on my way home from the subway .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The food did take a few extra minutes to come , but the cute waiters ' jokes and friendliness made up for it .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Most importantly , it is reasonably priced .	O O O O O O B-AS O
The selection of food is excellent -LRB- I 'm not used to having much choice at restaurants -RRB- , and the atmosphere is great .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Only suggestion is that you skip the dessert , it was overpriced and fell short on taste .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O

Yes , they 're a bit more expensive then typical , but then again , so is their food .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Not terrible , but not the restaurant in the reviews of 2002 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I can say that the wraps , burgers and salads were all fresh , tasty and the mango margareta at $ 9 was WELL WORTH the money .	O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O

Montparnasse 's desserts -- especially the silken creme brulee and paper-thin apple tart -- are good enough on their own to make the restaurant worth the trip .	O O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

What a difference , the service was very comforting and the food was better than average , but what really standed out was such a dynamic and extensive beer list .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Frankly , the chinese food here is something I can make better at home .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O

For the price you pay for the food here , you 'd expect it to be at least on par with other Japanese restaurants .	O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I always find myself asking the waiter to make something bland and different than what is on the menu .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Good cake BUT : it was not the best cake i 've ever had , and definately not worth standing outside on the sidewalk being herded like cattle by indifferent and overworked employees .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The closest that I got was the Cherry Marscapone , but they were out of it that day .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O
The homage to India is most evident in the delectable roti canai appetizer , a fried pancake served with pungent curry dipping sauce , while the mango chicken offers a surprisingly sophisticated , fresh take on sweet-and-sour .

I have to say the place was awesome .	O O O O O O O O O
The ground chickpea soup we sampled as a starter tasted somewhat thin .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O
We requested they re-slice the sushi , and it was returned to us in small cheese-like cubes .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
The service , however , is a peg or two below the quality of food -LRB- horrible bartenders -RRB- , and the clientele , for the most part , are rowdy , loud-mouthed commuters -LRB- this could explain the bad attitudes from the staff -RRB- getting loaded for an AC/DC concert or a Knicks game .

Hip boutiques and bars on Ludlow add to the artsy , laid-back atmosphere at this Israeli-style takeout and eat-in burger joint .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Young neighborhood trendies graze at the counter during the day , while chic , art-house drinkers with heavy doses of the munchies pile in late at night .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The ambiance was fine , a little loud but still nice and romantic .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O

Very nice touch that very much fits the place .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O

We were seated promptly in close proximity to the dance floor .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
If you are here as a pre-show meal , hop in a cab and take the extra 10 minutes to go to the uptown location .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A plus was the good mix of people in their twenties that provided for great eye-candy while I was there .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The comments about fried foods is correct -LRB- below -RRB- but the other dishes , including the lamb entree and many of the salads -LRB- avocado shrimp -RRB- were quite good .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O
It 's best to go on a cold night with a close friend or a good book .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Slow service , but when you 're hanging around with groups of 10 or 20 , who really notices ?	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sauce is excellent -LRB- very fresh -RRB- with dabs of real mozzarella .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
Do n't ever bother - the drinks were awful , but it was the people who work there that really made this the worst experience at dining .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The room is a little plain , but it 's difficult to make such a small place exciting and I would not suggest that as a reason not to go .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prices even outside of restaurant week were great .	B-AS O O O O O O O O
A small , outdoor eating area makes for a private , comfortable space to study alone or meet up with friends .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O

for an appetizer , their calamari is a winner .	O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O

After dinner I heard music playing and discovered that there is a lounge downstairs .	O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O

The room is a gorgeous , bi-level space and the long bar perfect for a drink .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O
Now we moved out of the state and every visit to NYC includes a stop here .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two complaints - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O
I do n't remember what we had ; nothing was memorable .	O O O O O O O O O O O O

I was especially impressed during the bday party when the waitstaff went above and beyond in helping me decorate and bring out a bday cake as well as offering prompt and friendly service to a 15 person party .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O

We were seated next to a couple whose kitchen was being renovated and we agreed since we 're all foodies who eat out a lot - that this was n't a place we 'd return to .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The guac is fresh , yet lacking flavor , we like to add our fresh salsa into it .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O
The new menu has a few creative items , they were smart enough to keep some of the old favorites -LRB- but they raised the prices -RRB- , the staff is friendly most of the time , but I must agree with the person that wrote about their favorite words : No , ca n't , sorry ... , boy , they wo n't bend the rules for anyone .

Its good to go there for drinks if you do n't want to get drunk because you 'll be lucky if you can get one drink an hour the service is so bad .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O
