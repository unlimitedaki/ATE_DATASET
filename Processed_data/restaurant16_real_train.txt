This place must have cost the owners afortune to build .	O O O O O O O O O O O
The atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O

Suan is a great place that I often take my friends -LRB- classmates -RRB- too .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
The food is excellent !	O B-AS O O O
But the pizza is way to expensive .	O O B-AS O O O O O
I 've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most importantly , food is excellent .	O O O B-AS O O O
Great find in the West Village !	O O O O O O O
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
We did tip , I guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
The food was well prepared and the service impecable .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular .	O O O O O O O O O O

I 've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert , as well as a great green tea tempura .	O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that I could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
I 'm saving up for my next visit .	O O O O O O O O O

During the course of the past 3 months , the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up , but save room for dessert !	O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret .	O O O O O O O O O O O
The wait staff is very courteous and accomodating .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
Why ?	O O
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
The food was average to above-average ; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .	O O O O O O O O O

The sushi was awful !	O B-AS O O O
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O
Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ` special ' bagel experience .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST !	B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O

What 's the difference between the two ?	O O O O O O O O
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .	O O O O B-AS O O O O
They forgot a sandwich , did n't include plastic forks , and did n't include pita with the hummus platter .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

limited menu , no-so-fresh ingredients , thinly-sliced fish , fall-apart rice .	O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were then shooed inside .	O O O O O O

It is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The pastas are incredible , the risottos -LRB- particularly the sepia -RRB- are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O
I was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O

All in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Service was prompt and courteous .	B-AS O O O O O
Decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing !	B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O

Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Yakitori -LRB- bbq meats -RRB- is tasty too .	B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave.	O O O O O O O O O
This place is great .	O B-AS O O O
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that 's all the service I need ...	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad -LRB- they are all good -RRB-	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic .	O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .	O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O

The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection -LRB- though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience -RRB- .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And really large portions .	O O O B-AS O

Quite simply it 's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The food however , is what one might expect .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Really , I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds -- this , in the city of a million restaurants , at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O

I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere !	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too -- but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .	O B-AS O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
If you do n't like it , I do n't know what to tell you .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong , it actually means Great Prosperity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .	O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't waste money on decor .	O O O O O B-AS O
Good , fast service .	O O O B-AS O
My mom originally introduced me to this place , but even she -LRB- being Indian -RRB- feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction	B-AS I-AS O O O O O

The food was good too .	O B-AS O O O O
Over the years the host , Vittorio , and his crew , have always treated me as family -- although with all the business this not-so-little gem does , it amazing he 's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor .

As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A real dissapointment .	O O O O
Have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O

I was in love with Pongsri on 48th , but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its located in greenewich village .	O O O O O O
The food is prepared quickly and efficiently .	O O O O O O O O
If you want to dine with large party , I recommend to make reservation BASEMENT .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta -LRB- raddichio was kind of bitter though -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Food - awesome .	B-AS O O O

Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Priced at upper intermediate range .	O O O O O O

Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not worth it .	O O O O
The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking , which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
Great food , great prices , great service .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O

Ess-A-Bagel -LRB- either by Sty-town or midtown -RRB- is by far the best bagel in NY .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O

Then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend 's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices ...	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town .	O O O O O O O O O O
I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
I go out to eat and like my courses , servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
I loved it and would go again .	O O O O O O O O
I ordered the vitello alla marsala and I was pretty impressed .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In any event , this is a place I 'll be sure to stop by again when I 'm in this part of town .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was wonderful .	O O O O

Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
Have frequented ` ino for several years and the food remains excellent .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Another review here claimed the pre-fix was $ 29/per person including sake but it is $ 55 per person not including sake .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We all felt it was worth it .	O O O O O O O O
This is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O

I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prices are very good .	O O O O O
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I heartily recommend .	O O O O
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek -LRB- for Chinatown -RRB- alternative .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!	O O O
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent !!	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
I like the ambience , it 's very dark and original .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass -LRB- that 's about 2 drinks -RRB- for $ 8.50 -LRB- I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! -RRB- in a great homey setting with great music .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O

Bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
Was n't going to share but I feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .

Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I do not recommend .	O O O O O
The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , the sandwiches -LRB- nearing $ 7 -RRB- did n't come with anything like chips or a side .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The mussles were the fishiest things I 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting .

I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Also they were $ 15 each !	O O O O O O O

This restaurant was recommended by a local ... as a matter of fact , he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O

The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We 've found it to be better and fresher than Kiku which is comparable in price .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O

stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .	O O O B-AS O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O

The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
For authentic Thai food , look no further than Toons .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants , he replied this is not Mcdonald 's , every place makes things differently	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

An awesome organic dog , and a conscious eco friendly establishment .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O

I ca n't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff , because despite the current one this is a great place .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O

The kitchen however , is almost always slow .	O B-AS O O O O O O O
My friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos .	O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
the pad se ew chicken was delicious , however the pad thai was far too oily .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .	O B-AS I-AS O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
It is thick and slightly soggy .	O O O O O O O
On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes , Flatbush Farm is n't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world , but it 's pretty good , albeit with a somewhat dismal setting .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it !	O O O O O O O O O
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O
Will not be back .	O O O O O

everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful .	O O O O O O O
What a great place .	O O O B-AS O
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .	B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
Amazing !	O O
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi .	O O O O O O O O O O O
We had a good time .	O O O O O O
Oh , and I never write reviews -- I just was so moved by how bad this place was , I felt it was my duty to spread the word .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
it is not consistent .	O O O O O
Have the iced tea .	O O B-AS I-AS O
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
Food is great and inexpensive .	B-AS O O O O O
Sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance .	B-AS O O O O O O O
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .	O O O B-AS O O O O
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'll be back for sure .	O O O O O O O
But that is highly forgivable .	O O O O O O
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O
bottles of wine are cheap and good .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
The food was bland oily .	O B-AS O O O O
The omlette for brunch is great ...	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O
We were less than impressed .	O O O O O O
Service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Service was slow , but the people were friendly .	B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O
I lOVE THIS PLACE !	O O O B-AS O
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed , there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Good luck getting a table .	O O O O O O
Such a disappointment ...	O O O O
The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O
I would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
This place is a great bargain .	O B-AS O O O O O
We love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !	O O O B-AS O B-AS O O B-AS O
enough said !	O O O
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .	O O O O O O O O O O O
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese -LRB- gets a little messy -RRB- .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I know because I live nearby .	O O O O O O O
If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza -LRB- as I love La Pizza Fresca -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz . of Maine Lobster in it .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
The seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
The food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split -LRB- rather than one appetizer and entree per person -RRB- for two people .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was speechless by the horrible food .	O O O O O O B-AS O
The price very reasonable .	O O O O O
La Rosa waltzes in , and I think they are doing it the best .	B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We did n't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
The sake menu should not be overlooked !	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
I 'm not picky - but it was actually gross .	O O O O O O O O O O O
This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
I am going to the mid town location next .	O O O O O O O O O O
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants , this is not the place for you .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One of my favorite places in Manhattan .	O O O O O O O O
Nice value .	O O O
The Steak Tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !	B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
However , if you want great food at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Service was prompt , friendly and great .	B-AS O O O O O O O
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O
I was visiting New York City with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Guacamole + shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .	B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This restaurant was way overhyped .	O B-AS O O O O
