But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And they provided a delicious dessert on the house !	O O O O O B-AS O O O O
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine , so if you want to make a reservation you are limited .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O

When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside , she recommended that we go to this restaurant .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The best pad thai i 've ever had .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
Over time , the food quality has decreased substantially , it is a lot less crowded than it used to , and the service must definitely be part of the reason .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O

I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I really did n't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
None of that yucky whipped stuff .	O O O O O O O
The wine list is n't great , and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno 's down the street , which is not as good as it used to be .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

As far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .	O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O

Perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker , here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion -LRB- and price -RRB- .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O

This place is always packed .	O O O O O O
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Plus they made a perfect martini .	O O O O O B-AS O
I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
All in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .	O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O
This place is worth going even if only for their beer .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

Good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O
While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O

The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
If you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY .	O O O O O O O O
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .	O O O O O B-AS O O
Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O

The food came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O

The food was great and the service was even better .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O
While this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten : $ 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef -LRB- usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt -RRB- .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O

We were seated and ignored by waitstaff .	O O O O O O B-AS O
If you are in a big group , this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O

The burger was great , also .	O B-AS O O O O O
they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the service was horrible .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT !	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
The pizza was great .	O B-AS O O O
And everytime I go there 's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty -LRB- could 've used a bit more salt -RRB- .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
When we notified him that he did n't mention the specials , he did n't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O
Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O
I 've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Delicious food , excellent service , and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $ 5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch !	O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O
For appetizers , I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS O

Sake collection was excellent -LRB- Try Nanbu Bijin -RRB- , but pricy .	B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O

Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable , makes students go back to Suan again and again .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
