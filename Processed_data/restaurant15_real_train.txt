Ess-A-Bagel -LRB- either by Sty-town or midtown -RRB- is by far the best bagel in NY .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O

Also very inexpensive .	O O O O
Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
We 've lived in the area for more than 8 years .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Looking around , I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
I thought this place was totally overrated .	O O O B-AS O O O O
The food was absolutely amazing !!	O B-AS O O O O
also it 's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place , the service it 's just perfect ... they 're so frendly that we never want to live the place !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O

The food is excellent !	O B-AS O O O
Good spreads , great beverage selections and bagels really tasty .	O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS O O O
I will be out with friends and all of a sudden I am hungry and I only crave one thing ... their Pizza .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 've waited over one hour for food .	O O O O O O O O O
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting .	B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O
It is also extremely well priced .	O O O O O O O
Leon is an East Village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic French bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O
We picked it randomly , without a recommendation from someone who has been there , so we were n't sure what to expect .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Make sure you try this place as often as you can .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
I ca n't wait to go back .	O O O O O O O O
I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .	O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O
A little noise but I think that was because of our party !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food was average to above-average ; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
DO not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
The setting is casual and romantic .	O B-AS O O O O O
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too -- but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area .	O B-AS O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
The fish was really , really fresh .	O B-AS O O O O O O
Such a disappointment ...	O O O O
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!	O O O
Ambience is delightful , service impeccable .	B-AS O O O B-AS O O
Conveniently located too , being right on Bedford ave.	O O O O O O O O O
I went there with my friend last saturday .	O O O O O O O O O
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By far , the best pizza in Manhattan .	O O O O O B-AS O O O
And it all comes at a very reasonable price -LRB- congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
It 's boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average ... the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O
I am so coming back here again , as much as I can .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bagels are ok , but be sure not to make any special requests !	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The service is awful .	O B-AS O O O
Better than the bagel shop on the corner , but not worth going out of your way for , in my opinion .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O B-AS O
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
Compared to Ess-a , Tal offers a less doughy bagel !	O O O O O O O O O O O
I had my eyes on this place , promising myself I will one day ` give it a try . '	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The lox is always fresh too .	O B-AS O O O O O
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent !!	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese -LRB- gets a little messy -RRB- .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
Despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Much more reasonably priced too !	O O O O O O
The food is amazing ... especially if you get the Chef 's tasting menu and your favourite bottle -LRB- or two ! -RRB- of wine from an extensive selection of wines .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
Great wine selection , Gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .	O B-AS I-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
But , they were too big for the bun .	O O O O O O O O O O
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Decor is charming .	B-AS O O O
Whenever you need a Sushi fix , Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
Food is great and inexpensive .	B-AS O O O O O
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This restaurant is VEGETARIAN ; there are NO MEAT dishes whatsoever .	O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy .	B-AS O O O O O O O
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .	O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
There was a small wait , but shorter than I expected .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O

The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O
Sit outside in the warm weather ; inside for cozy winter .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Fantastic !	O O
I sometimes see the waiters do n't have enough knowledge of their dishes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Service is average .	B-AS O O O
This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O

Love YUKA .	O B-AS O
Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good ... not outstanding , but good .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O
A guaranteeed delight !	O O O O
Overall , excellent restaurant !	O O O B-AS O
But the pizza is way to expensive .	O O B-AS O O O O O
The place was quiet and delightful .	O B-AS O O O O O
Still , any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house ...	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome , great appetizer to share !	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
The sushi is amazing !!!	O B-AS O O O
I expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough -LRB- both in quantity AND quality -RRB- .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do n't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the service directory .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
The anti-pasta was excellent , especially the calamari , as were the filling pasta mains .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
and you ca n't beat the prices .	O O O O O O O O
Avoid this place !	O O B-AS O
the waitstaffs are nice though .	O B-AS O O O O
Consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ` nt feel like finishing them .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Never fails to please .	O O O O O
For instance , plates were just dumped on the table , I was handed the wine list upside down , etc. ...	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart 's for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O
Its located in greenewich village .	O O O O O O
Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
Thank You Emilio .	O O B-AS O
NO PIZZA 33 for me !	O B-AS I-AS O O O
What a great place .	O O O B-AS O
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . hmmm .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n't quite match up .	B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
While their kitchen food is delicious , their Sushi is out of this world .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O
It 's to die for !	O O O O O O
it 's delicious !	O O O O
It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tiny dessert was $ 8.00 ... just plain overpriced for what it is .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i 'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much ... and we 're repeat customers .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O
I also ordered the Change Mojito , which was out of this world .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Good for dates or with friends .	O O O O O O O
The food here is rather good , but only if you like to wait for it .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would just ask for no oil next time .	O O O O O O O O O O
I went here with a friend on a whim , we went someplace else first and could n't get a table .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O
first it took us a long time to find the place .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O
I 'm saving up for my next visit .	O O O O O O O O O

The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But too far east !	O O O O O
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi -LRB- on saffron risotto - yum ! -RRB- .	O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .	O O O O O O O O O O O
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
well , i did n't find it there , and trust , i have told everyone i can think of about my experience .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
I definitely would n't go back .	O O O O O O O

We were very disappointed .	O O O O O
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash .	O O O O O O O O
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat . . but planning an event , especially a small , intimate one , forget about it .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT !	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
I/we will never go back to this place again .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O
Always busy but fast moving .	O O O O O O
I look forward to eating here again	O O O O O O O
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is a great place to take out-of-towners , and perfect for watching the sunset .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I have known about this secret for the last 13 years , Emilio -LRB- the Godfather -RRB- has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .	O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
but the service was a bit slow .	O O B-AS O O O O O
Great sushi experience .	O B-AS O O
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our server was very helpful and friendly .	O B-AS O O O O O O
The decor is night tho ... but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un-appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
Love Pizza 33 . .	O B-AS I-AS O O
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma 's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge -LRB- although they have more funky toppings ! -RRB-	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fish is so very fresh .	B-AS O O O O O
As we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance , but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
I 've been many time and have never been disappointed .	O O O O O O O O O O O
You can get a completely delish martini in a glass -LRB- that 's about 2 drinks -RRB- for $ 8.50 -LRB- I recommend the Vanilla Shanty , mmmm ! -RRB- in a great homey setting with great music .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O

Beautiful experience .	O O O
Also , specify if you like your food spicy - its rather bland if you do n't .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I absolutely Loved this place .	O O O O B-AS O
Give it a try and enjoy .	O O O O O O O
Also , the sandwiches -LRB- nearing $ 7 -RRB- did n't come with anything like chips or a side .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
too large for just two people but nothing was left .	O O O O O O O O O O O
We liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Drawbacks : service is slow and they do n't toast !	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Quite simply it 's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Went here on a friend 's reccomendation .	O O O O O O O O
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O

But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere , delightfully free of the BTs .	O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Service was also very good .	B-AS O O O O O
The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All in all we 're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks !!!!	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
fresh restaurant was amazing . food was delicious and of course fresh .	B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : Where are you from ... maybe you dont know how things work in America ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .

delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O

Frankly , when you compare what you can have here for lunch , versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city , there is no comparison .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the kind of place you 'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food , better then places like Balthazar etc. .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

For those of you who do n't know , Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese , which happens to be my favorite . -RRB-	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

They charge different prices all the time .	O O O O O O O O

Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O
The wine list is also really nice .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND .	O O O O O O O O
Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O

However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !	O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
Went on a 3 day oyster binge , with Fish bringing up the closing , and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended , because it was so great !	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

This place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food is reliable and the price is moderate .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY -- I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
All the staff is absolutely professional !!	O O B-AS O O O O
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Salads were fantastic .	B-AS O O O
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .	B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
Service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n't be beat !!!	B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But that is highly forgivable .	O O O O O O
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
The food was authentic .	O B-AS O O O
The Yellowtail was particularly good as well .	O B-AS O O O O O O

Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction	B-AS I-AS O O O O O
The food is yummy , especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O
I have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
You must try the shrimp appetizers .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O
You will find yourself returning quite often .	O O O O O O O O
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two complaints - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There are other people waiting !	O O O O O O
However , I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once .	O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prices are in line .	O O O O O
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .	O O O O B-AS O O O O
It is thick and slightly soggy .	O O O O O O O
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .	B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
The ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O

Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
I 'm partial to the Gnocchi .	O O O O O B-AS O
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Murray wo n't do it .	O O O O O O
We had Lava Cake ... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Warning : You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

Not a great place for family or general dining .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O

The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
I have to agree with the previous reviewer .	O O O O O O O O O

I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table .	O O O O O O O O O O O
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Been there , done that , and New York , it 's not that big a deal .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , the rice had no seasoning , so the sushi was bland and disgusting .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
I felt as though I were eating in Paris .	O O O O O O O O O O

The worst excuse for Japanese food I 've ever encountered .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection -LRB- though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience -RRB- .

The service is ok , some of the people did n't get what they asked for .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
While it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In any event , this is a place I 'll be sure to stop by again when I 'm in this part of town .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was pleasantly suprised .	O O O O O

I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

A big disappointment , all around .	O O O O O O O
I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
Waitstaff are very friendly .	B-AS O O O O

Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES , I get angry that I did n't just go to Zucchero Pomodori .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Molto bene !	O O O
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O

The sake menu should not be overlooked !	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O

Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O
Guacamole + shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .	B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
