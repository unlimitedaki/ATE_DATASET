Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Not working = bad	O O O O
I had 3 months when the ports started going out .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
I think this computer is super lame .	O O O O O O O O
After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs -LRB- delivery service was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again -RRB- , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm Very disappointed in Dell .	O O O O O O O
WIth the upgraded memory , the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once !	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O
I will NEVER buy -LRB- Refurbished -RRB- again , I do n't cae how cheap it is .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's the inside that is truly wonderful .	O O O O O O O O O
I did not have to call the support line at all .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O
Will not buy another Toshiba , this is my second , not happy w / either .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The difference is phenomenal .	O O O O O
If you are a person like me , more on the creative side , the mac has something for you too .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours .	O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
also the battery is completely shot .	O O B-AS O O O O
Perfect trifecta !	O O O
Honestly , this is absolutely wonderful .	O O O O O O O
The capabilities using that program alone made me want a Mac .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
So , if you 're thinking of a laptop , I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer -LRB- Z0J80001 -RRB- Notebook for all your needs !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O
Reason why ? It 's because when you buy it , you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop , the price will stay the same for the next year , and even if Apple does decides to change mode , your laptop value will only drop 10-20 % , unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80 % .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I ca n't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
Also , I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen , which is noticable to me .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
The battery has never worked well .	O B-AS O O O O O
It turned out it 's not really a problem to have a Mac .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As with any laptop not purchased with software options , it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
If you have the money I suggest going for the i7 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Screen is crystal clear , yes it 's small - but it 's a netbook !	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Great laptop that offers many great features !	O O O O O O B-AS O
I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident -LRB- long story -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
So a couple of years later , I was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary , some folks indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix , others had the repair done 5 times .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
Has a 5-6 hour battery life .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O
The apple macbook pro nothing to say butprofessionally great and outstanding .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O

, Applications respond immediately -LRB- not like the tired MS applications -RRB- .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O
Getting the Apple Care plan is a must .	O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O
i would have to say that overall its great !	O O O O O O O O O O

This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine ;	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O

What 's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

But let me tell you , the mac book pro is so professional .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Other than that , I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O

Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .

My real problem with it ? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it 's a lie .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Save your money and go for a better device .	O O O O O O O O O O
