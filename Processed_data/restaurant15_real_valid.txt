Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat .	B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously , but it should n't .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED !	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Go there once and oh yes ... you will go back ... you will ...	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
What a great place !	O O O B-AS O
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant .	O O O O O O B-AS O
A cool bar with great food , and tons of excellent beer .	O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O
And even with it 's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Loved it !	O O O
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens , this is among the best .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O
It is expensive but well worth the money .	O O O O O O O O O
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The only thing more wonderful than the food -LRB- which is exceptional -RRB- is the service .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O
The only thing the waiters do n't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wonderful at holiday time .	O O O O O
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed .	B-AS O O O O O O O
Food was very good , but not what I would consider out of this world .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless , so was the seafood tagliatelle .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
A real dissapointment .	O O O O
But that was n't the icing on the cake : a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Priced at upper intermediate range .	O O O O O O
I really liked this place .	O O O O B-AS O
Everything I had was good , and I 'm a eater .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was pretty inexpensive too .	O O O O O O
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee -LRB- rice porridge -RRB- .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
However , if you want great food at a great price and do n't mind the decor , you ca n't beat this place .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Quick and friendly service .	O O O B-AS O
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .	O O O O O O O O O O
When I 'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office , I head for Cafe St. Bart 's .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When you 're sitting in their main dining room -LRB- which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling -RRB- you 'd never know there was a world outside .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Ahhh ...	O O
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They all know you .	O O O O O
Good food .	O B-AS O
Good drink .	O B-AS O
How do you rate home ?	O O O O O O
I have never had cheescake like this .	O O O O B-AS O O O
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .	O O O O O O O O O O
Great spot , whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months .	O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
Have been several times and it never dissapoints .	O O O O O O O O O
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were less than impressed .	O O O O O O
While the ambiance and atmosphere were great , the food and service could have been a lot better .	O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O
We ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Probably would not go again ...	O O O O O O
i 've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine , if not good .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
stick with the chicken , beef , and lamb dishes .	O O O B-AS O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .	O O O O O O O O
skip dessert .	O B-AS O
Best Reuben sandwich ever !	O B-AS I-AS O O
A classic !	O O O
Do n't miss Bloom 's on your next trip to Manhatten .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O

Thanks Bloom 's for a lovely trip .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
As a fan of Thai , I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
It just was n't Thai .	O O O O O O
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza -LRB- as I love La Pizza Fresca -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Was surprisingly disappointed .	O O O O
Pizza was a little soggy .	B-AS O O O O O
Ravioli was good ... but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not enough wines by the glass either .	O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O
Service , however , was excellent ... and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Food was just average ... if they lowered the prices just a bit , it would be a bigger draw .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This place is a great bargain .	O B-AS O O O O O
Authentic Pakistani food .	O B-AS I-AS O
People are always friendly .	B-AS O O O O
Do n't waste money on decor .	O O O O O O O
Just straight up cheap , good food .	O O O O O O B-AS O
Faan is sooo good .	B-AS O O O O
The best pad thai i 've ever had .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
The design and atmosphere is just as good .	O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O
bottles of wine are cheap and good .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
What more could you want ?	O O O O O O
The food was actually aweful .	O B-AS O O O O
I 'm not picky - but it was actually gross .	O O O O O O O O O O O
The mussles were the fishiest things I 've ever tasted , the seabass was bland , the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese , the penne w / chicken had bones in it ... It was disgusting .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .	O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O
Would n't recomend it for dinner !	O O O O O O O
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples .	O O O O O O O O O O
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
The food is amazing , rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
Best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .	O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O
If only they delivered , they 'd make a mint !	O O O O O O O O O O O
go here for the drinks !	O O O O B-AS O
esp . during happy hour !	O O O O O O
enough said !	O O O
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Ask for Usha , the nicest bartender in manhattan .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O
My fav was the sassy lassi ...	O O O O B-AS I-AS O
This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls .	O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
I really recommend the very simple Unda -LRB- Egg -RRB- rolls .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .	O B-AS O B-AS O B-AS O O O B-AS O
Amazing !	O O
Toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food 's as good as ever .	O B-AS O O O O O O
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food , this is one of the best spots .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
Went here last night - nice decor , good service , but the food was surprisingly excellent .	O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split -LRB- rather than one appetizer and entree per person -RRB- for two people .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants , this offers by far one of the best values for your money .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ca n't wait to go back .	O O O O O O O
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town !	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O
Beef noodle soup is good as well .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
The service is good and the resturant is clean .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O
Best Taiwanese food in NY !	O B-AS I-AS O O O
I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all I can say is that they just do n't get it .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Rao 's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC .	O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O
Good luck getting a table .	O O O O O O
My roommate and I LOVE this place .	O O O O O O B-AS O
We recently decided to try this location , and to our delight , they have outdoor seating , perfect since I had my yorkie with me .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O
Indoor was very cozy and cute .	B-AS O O O O O O
The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Staff is very accomodating .	B-AS O O O O
Excellent dumplings served amid clean , chic decor .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O
I got the $ 10 10-piece dim sum combo , every bite of which was great .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
But $ 1 for each small piece ???	O O O O O O O O
Not worth it .	O O O O
I wo n't go back unless someone else is footing the bill .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The decor is very simple but comfortable .	O B-AS O O O O O O
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
I loved it and would go again .	O O O O O O O O
Great Indian food and the service is incredible .	O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O O
The owner truly caters to all your needs .	O B-AS O O O O O O O
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets , and then ordered for them .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .	O O O O O O O O O
Great food and the prices are very reasonable .	O B-AS O O O O O O O
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong , it actually means Great Prosperity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food here does a great service to the name -LRB- Cantonese that is ... -RRB- .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh , a delicious and sweet tasting bread .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices ...	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
Service is not what you are coming here for ...	B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that 's all the service I need ...	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach .	B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
this place ... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .	O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O
even the wine by the glass was good .	O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O
its a little out of the way if you do n't live in the neighborhood , but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Consistently good Japanese Tapas .	O O B-AS I-AS O
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon , which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Always good drinks and service is pretty good ;	O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O
Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too ...	B-AS O O O O O O
A great place to meet up for some food and drinks ...	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Yakitori -LRB- bbq meats -RRB- is tasty too .	B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O
It 's also attached to Angel 's Share , which is a cool , more romantic bar ...	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
Was n't going to share but I feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No thanks !!!	O O O
This place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens ' biggest secret !	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you 're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant , very very good food , cheaply-priced , generally friendly staff , and if you 're a Manhattanite , or spend most of your time in Manhattan , Rice Avenue will make you feel at home ... very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele ... all on Roosevelt Avenue !	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were then shooed inside .	O O O O O O
One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We left , never to return .	O O O O O O O
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
If you are in the area try The Bagel Shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd Ave.	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town .	O O O O O O O O O O
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .	B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O
The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
He offers subpar service and has no personality .	O O O B-AS O O O O O
In fact , it appears he is going to go postal at any moment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Skip this location and go to the one in Soho .	O O O O O O O O O O O
There is no excuse for such lousy service !	O O O O O O O B-AS O
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .	O O O O O O O O O O
You can do it here .	O O O O O O
$ 20 for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends , and spent three enjoyable hours there .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most of the servers are very attentive , friendly and quite attractive .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd , but there were a few groups of mid 20 's / 30 year olds also .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy , service was great and the food was excellent !	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O
Me and my girls will definitely go back .	O O O O O O O O O
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .	B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
I 've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times , but more often I order delivery .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food is great .	O B-AS O O O
Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights .	B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
I heartily recommend .	O O O O
There is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys -LRB- a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup -RRB- who always seem disappointed with their tips .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hey , I think $ 2 + for a 5 block walk ai n't bad .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Love the scene first off - the place has a character and nice light to it . . very fortunate , location wise .	O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
The pizza was pretty good and huge .	O B-AS O O O O O O
The price very reasonable .	O O O O O
We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally .	O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
