But the staff was so horrible to us .	O O B-AS O O O O O O
To be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food is uniformly exceptional , with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating , whether it 's on the menu or not .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
For those that go once and do n't enjoy it , all I can say is that they just do n't get it .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not only was the food outstanding , but the little ` perks ' were great .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
It is very overpriced and not very tasty .	O O O O O O O O O
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken -LRB- usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats -RRB- .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chewy yet not gummy .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good .	O O B-AS O O O O O
They did not have mayonnaise , forgot our toast , left out ingredients -LRB- ie cheese in an omelet -RRB- , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .	O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
It took half an hour to get our check , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk !	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
The design and atmosphere is just as good .	O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O
He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
I would definitely recommend Mary 's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
He ca n't help , they 're bought up so fast .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Secondly , on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i have eaten here a handful of times , for no reason besides sheer convenience .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Obviously run by folks who know a pie .	O O O O O O O O O
We were very disappointed .	O O O O O
IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE .	O O O O O O O
I really liked this place .	O O O O O O
I will be going back very soon .	O O O O O O O O
All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O
The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I asked for seltzer with lime , no ice .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O
It was pretty inexpensive too .	O O O O O O
Will not be back .	O O O O O
Do n't go alone -- even two people is n't enough for the whole experience , with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
My suggestion is to eat family style because you 'll want to try the other dishes .	O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Best of all is the warm vibe , the owner is super friendly and service is fast .	O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O
This is n't a value joint .	O O O O O O O
Faan 's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
From the incredible food , to the warm atmosphere , to the friendly service , this downtown neighborhood spot does n't miss a beat .	O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
Great food at REASONABLE prices , makes for an evening that ca n't be beat !	O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning .	O O O O O O O O O
The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth 's is the Strip House .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O
You 'll adore it .	O O O O O
Two words : Free wine .	O O O O B-AS O
The price is reasonable although the service is poor .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O
The quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
I have been to Roth 's twice and both times were very disappointing .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers , we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
Raga 's is a romantic , cozy restaurant .	O O O O O O O O O
The fried rice is amazing here .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels , puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing , and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
it 's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
At the end you 're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
The wine list is excellent .	O B-AS I-AS O O O
so garantuan that you ca n't fit them in a toaster .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before , and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had -LRB- except for my mom 's of course -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O
I highly recommend the Sophia pizza .	O O O O O O O
Whem asked , we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner .	O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O B-AS O
Nice atmosphere , the service was very pleasant and the desert was good .	O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O
All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
Fabulous service , fantastic food , and a chilled out atmosphere and environment .	O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O
Not what I wanted to hear .	O O O O O O O
Try the lasagnette appetizer .	O O B-AS I-AS O
Pricey , but worth a try , at least once .	O O O O O O O O O O O
I 've been there a few times , and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I liked the beer selection !	O O O B-AS I-AS O
Great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting .	O B-AS O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O
Ca n't wait to go back .	O O O O O O O
I grew up eating Dosa and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
If you are a carnivore , come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Not too crazy about their sake martini .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Great bagels , spreads and a good place to hang out in .	O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
The service varys from day to day - sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
whoever the jazz duo was , they were on POINT .	O O O O O O O O O O O
One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
This place is a great bargain .	O O O O O O O
We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unfortunately , the food is outstanding , but everything else about this restaurant is the pits .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks , swirl them around , and eat .	O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
My husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly , helpful , and willing to the extra mile for a customer .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The pizza was pretty good and huge .	O B-AS O O O O O O
Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I 'm in NYC .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The cuisine from what I 've gathered is authentic Taiwanese , though its very different from what I 've been accustomed to in Taipei .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I heartily recommend .	O O O O
Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
The atmosphere is unheralded , the service impecible , and the food magnificant .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O
We ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The wait staff is friendly , and the food has gotten better and better !	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
This place , which is only a few months old , is perhaps Queens ' biggest secret !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
This place is so much fun .	O O O O O O O
I was glad I did .	O O O O O O
Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
I 've never been treated so rudely .	O O O O O O O O
I 'll be back soon .	O O O O O O
Le Pere Pinard has a $ 15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
Went inside and I started to get excited .	O O O O O O O O O
I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O
However , it is jus too good to not praise it .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have been to Montparnasse many times and return often for good reason .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
It 's somewhere you can eat and be happy .	O O O O O O O O O O
If you wrote a bad review , it 's because you do n't understand what Rao 's is all about .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from , but we had been there less than an hour and they had n't even brought us a check yet !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
but overall i give it a 10	O O O O O O O
Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat , with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll , it is well worth the price you pay for them .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O
I have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n't have my name .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee -LRB- rice porridge -RRB- .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
This was one of the BEST restaurants I 've ever been to .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This restaurant used to be pretty decent .	O O O O O O O O
An oasis of refinement : Food , though somewhat uneven , often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef 's passion -LRB- and kitchen 's precise execution -RRB- is most evident in the fish dishes and soups .

I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
Some baby pizzas get their wish .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O
Plenty of choices to make your own creation .	O O O O O O O O O
It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone 's living room .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I was there on sat .	O O O O O O
Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
VT is what baby pizzas hope to be when they grow up .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
From the terrible service , to the bland food , not to mention the unaccommodating managers , the overall experience was horrible .	O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you 'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
The last time I went we were seated at a table in a corridor next to the kitchen .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
Nice restaurant overall , with classic upscale Italian decor .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Not impressed with the food .	O O O O B-AS O
The entire dining experience was wonderful !	O O B-AS I-AS O O O
The wine selection -LRB- by the glass and bottle -RRB- is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they 're going to be in town .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Service is highly refined : our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
Order the panang duck , it 's fantastic .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
Food is usually very good , though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
Other than the crappy service from two individuals , it 's great .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
What more can you ask for ?	O O O O O O O
Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They have authentic Indian at amazin prices .	O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
You are treated just like royality .	O O O O O O O
There 's nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 -LRB- or more -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ambiance - relaxed and stylish .	B-AS O O O O O
I 've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy 's Bronx Cafe .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon , Sea Bass and Crispy Duck .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS I-AS O B-AS I-AS O
Yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O
Looking from the outside in , one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall -LRB- really , that 's what it is -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

Tuk Tuk is one of those comfortable neighborhood joints where you know you will always have a good meal at a fair price .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
A glass of Leaping Lizard , a glass of prosecco , and the mussels had everything happy .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O O
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred , not caramelized and smelled of kerosene .	B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
The food always tastes fresh and served promptly .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O
I know because I live nearby .	O O O O O O O
The pizza here is delicious .	O B-AS O O O O
My entire family was horrified .	O O O O O O
On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pizza and garlic knots are great as well , I order from them quite often and the delivery is always super quick !	B-AS O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
For great chinese food nearby , you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye .	O O O O O O O O O O
Hats off to the chef .	O O O O B-AS O
This should have been done in a back room - away from customers .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things -LRB- the heavy , black , antique-seeming teapot , for one -RRB- in the restaurant experience .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers .	O O O O O O O O O O O
The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria 's .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York .	O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
service is friendly , and never had a problem walking in and getting a table .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Check it out	O O O
First off , the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her -LRB- odd in a restaurant with 6 tables -RRB- and got our order wrong .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Do n't go .	O O O O
The food was bland oily .	O B-AS O O O O
But they do .	O O O O
What is even better , is that the prices are very affordable as well , and the food is really good .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O
Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place -LRB- PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Ambiance and music funky , which I enjoy .	B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O
The food , drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city .	O B-AS O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O
It 's a really great deal , considering we got full off of four dollars .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic , alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods , the tastes , the experiance .

Try the tandoori salmon !	O O B-AS I-AS O
I am completely hooked on this place , it is ridiculous .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it 's a very disappointing experience .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Granted the space is smaller than most , it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
Have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .	O O O O O O O O O O O O

I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
The pizza is good though .	O B-AS O O O O
bottles of wine are cheap and good .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O

Walk-ins are risky too .	O O O O O
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O
They did n't give us the dinner special until we asked for it .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O B-AS O
word of advice , save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you 've had the tiramisu .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O

Open late -LRB- well as late as I ever got there and I 'm a night person -RRB-	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The most annoying thing , though , is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Get your food to go , find a bench , and kick back with a plate of dumplings .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O

Went there last night for 2 year anniversery , and was n't all that impressed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were seated promptly as we had reservations , however after that the service was slow .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O
At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We visit at least once a month .	O O O O O O O O
It is set far from the small street it 's on , and there is no traffic noise .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Also , the place is popular with families , so if you 're bothered by children running loose like wild animals , come later at night to avoid them .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'll keep this short .	O O O O O O
I felt as though I were eating in Paris .	O O O O O O O O O O

I work near-by , and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood - not a packaged or quick-cooked item .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
Always busy but fast moving .	O O O O O O
Too bad the food was n't of the same heritage .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
The menu looked good , except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass , but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O

overall , a solid restaurant and at less than $ 40pp -LRB- including wine -RRB- , a solid deal as well .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall , it 's a bit intimidating at first , but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - do n't hesitate to ask for help with what to get .

Based on the reviews for dinner , this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that , but definitely not for Dim Sum again .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O
It costs $ 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll , but the roll more than triples in size , and that 's not just from the rice .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Even with John 's and Joe 's around the corner , this place will make a name for itself .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The dim sum is ok but does n't taste that fresh , and the little dishes do n't look steamy hot as they should -LRB- also note lack of Chinese here -RRB- .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
despite the untasteful previous review ...	O O O O O O
Do n't judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sure , everyone 's got their favorite , but to know Sal , is to know New York .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The service was attentive .	O B-AS O O O
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella , but every pie is ultra fresh .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O
Fish was overdone .	B-AS O O O
Great idea and base for restaurant , but work on the details , people who think this was good need to go back to the shore towns and rethink what it should have tasted like .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When you 're sitting in their main dining room -LRB- which has a spectacular , hand-painted high ceiling -RRB- you 'd never know there was a world outside .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS O
I have been twice to this restaurant .	O O O O O O O O
also make sure you pay attention to the music being piped in - quite a weird selection .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
You could get a much better dining experience for the same amount of money in a lot of other French Bistros .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O
The rest of the dim sum , though pricey by Chinatown standards , is worth it .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
Good food .	O B-AS O
The wait staff is very friendly , if not overly efficient .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .	O O O O O O O O O
The dim sum however was very good .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
It 's better than being on the roof of Sutton Place with 19 year old interns jabbing you in the ribs all night .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Service has always been friendly and efficient .	B-AS O O O O O O O
Went there and had a combination of different seafood dishes and appetizers .	O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS O
Its a great place for a casual date or to entertain clients for lunch .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The table next to us asked if he crushed the grapes himself when their long overdue bottle of wine finally arrived .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O
Prices are very good .	B-AS O O O O
We could not catch our waiter 's eye , and he ignored us .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Fantastic place .	O O O
Plain and simple it 's bad thai food .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Definitely not a restaurant to skip !	O O O O O O O
They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Usually 3 vs. 4 items per dish .	O O O O O O B-AS O
While certain staples are excellent -LRB- the burger , some of the pastas -RRB- , the food is not really the point .	O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O
The Dim Sum was so-so , but not spectacular .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
The food was so-so .	O B-AS O O O
The waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints , and has a bar which deserves a mention .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
What a ripoff !	O O O O

You can do it here .	O O O O O O
Food - awesome .	B-AS O O O
good music , great food , speedy service affordable prices .	O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O B-AS O
There was a small wait , but shorter than I expected .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
The lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
May , the owner always has a smile on her and will warmly greet you .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 've lived in NY for 5 years and this place has it all .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I just read Mocaramel 's review and felt compelled to respond .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sides were ok and incredibly salty .	O B-AS O O O O O O
It hits the spot every time	O O O O O O
For some reason , all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon .	O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O
Not a large place , but it 's cute and cozy .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Do n't be fooled by crowds of people .	O O O O O O O O O
and there 's no way out .	O O O O O O O
The beverages were excellent , and the dessert was good .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O
The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .	O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Next time , we would n't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS O
Please if your thinking about it go , and stay the wait you wo n't be disappointed .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful !	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
If you 'd like to have a nice light meal with an asian accent , Long Tan is a good place on the slope .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When going out for a nice dinner , I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O
For all you lazy folks that do n't want to come to Alphabet City , I say , good - stay out .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Otherwise , this place has great service and prices and a nice friendly atmosphere .	O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O B-AS O
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service .	O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O B-AS O
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
A + + The service was good to excellent along with the attitude .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O
This is my fourth try over a two year period , and I 'm done .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
The music does get a little loud at times , but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife , and as I did , I got a whiff of corriander .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
black white shakes came out good also .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
It 's simply the best meal in NYC .	O O O O O B-AS O O O
Probably would not go again ...	O O O O O O
After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The seating was if they were trying to get the maximum amount of people into the restaurant , so be nice to your neighbor when you dine here .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ordered the chu chu curry and my friend ordered the pad thai chicken .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
We go on Mondays for the prix fixe and our experience with the food has been comparable to Blue Ribbon .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Tuk Tuk is my second favorite neighborhood Thai place -LRB- the first being Joya -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , they 've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way .	O B-AS O O O O O
This is some really good , inexpensive sushi .	O O O O O O O B-AS O
my personal favorite is an everything bagel with lox spread , but all the bagles are unbeliavably good .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O
I would n't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy , too .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Also good for client lunch meetings , esp .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O
For $ 600 -LRB- the most we have ever paid -RRB- not even waving a magic wand will ever get us back for a repeat performance .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The decor is dark , cool and soothing , while the food 's presentation is spectacular , considering the low prices .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS O
The Waitstaff were very nice and suggested swordfish for my husband he enjoyed his meal .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O
The setting is casual and romantic .	O B-AS O O O O O
IT WAS HORRIBLE .	O O O O
Terrible , terrible management - deserves to be shut-down .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Great friendly service , Fast seating , Fast Delivery , Excellent sushi .	O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
The Italian food has flavor -LRB- that can be sort of surprising on the UES -RRB- , and the service turns from a nightmare to attentive , they sort of remind me of the NY Yankees of the late 90 's , no matter how bad it look , you knew that there was a rally just around the corner ...	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish I had .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O
Mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
The New York Times has reviewed this place three times already , you know it 's going to be good .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Baluchi 's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices .	O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
Emilio , the owner , is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have been to spice three times - twice during lunch and once at dinner .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
Moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was VERY salty !	B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
I came to this restaurant expecting to be surprised but left bored and overcharged .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A cheap eat for NYC , but not for dosa .	O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O
The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
The seafood is amazing , there 's a good wine list , and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
i do n't usually order wine with indian so i ca n't comment on their wine list or their wines .	O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O
Pastrami or corned beef are juicy and piled high -LRB- ask for extra rye bread -RRB- .	B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O
-LRB- $ 200 for 2 glasses of champagne , not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks -RRB- .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O
Really though , where 's the seasoning ?	O O O O O O B-AS O
The food was just OK , at least for what food was available .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
by dinner time , they turn it around and mount a huge comeback !!	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
The ambience was nice , but service was n't so great .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O
Solid wine list , knowledgeable staff , friendly owners and an adventurous , ever-changing menu keep us coming back .	O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We did n't even see a menu , as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it .	O B-AS O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
otherwise , good stuff for late nite eats .	O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
The dinner was ok , nothing I would have again .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
It is thick and slightly soggy .	O O O O O O O
Its not the same if you have to sit inside .	O O O O O O O O O O O
I love and I know gourmet food by excellence !	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O
I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta , panini 's ...	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O
Great people watching as others do the same to you .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I 've experienced the same with other restaurants so I do n't appreciate such practice .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two people in our party felt like something else , and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O
He offers subpar service and has no personality .	O O O B-AS O O O O O
The waitress remembers me and is very friendly , she knows what my regular is and that 's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
I 'm going back .	O O O O O
Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer ...	O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O
My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
wow ! how have i missed this one , tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf -LRB- ok bad joke -RRB- , but you will see .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While we thoroughly enjoyed the food , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
Me and my girls will definitely go back .	O O O O O O O O O
The first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O
delicious bagels , especially when right out of the oven .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Ive passed by the spot tons of times always wanting to go in .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All the food was hot tasty .	O O B-AS O O O O
Have been several times and it never dissapoints .	O O O O O O O O O
This is one great place to eat pizza more out but not a good place for take-out pizza .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Our server was very helpful and friendly .	O B-AS O O O O O O
Try green curry with vegetables .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you do n't want to drop a ton of cash .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While I 'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This place was not ALL THAT !	O O O O O O O
First of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by Citysearch 's editorial review .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The second you walk through the heavy vault like door , with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Much more reasonably priced too !	O O O B-AS O O
If you venture off the island of Manhattan and ca n't seem to find a great Italian restaurant , drive to Corona .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food was not very tasty , the portioins were tiny even for such a high quality restaurant .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Others have to go to other restaurants and feel sad until they 're eaten .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Why make a reservation if you are n't going to keep it ?	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
The Pad Thai is excellent here , as well .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
Big and gawky on the outside .	O O O O O O O
I have been to Mary 's many times and I like it .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Searching to get out from the cold , freezing weather , we went into what we thought was a deli .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I do not recommend lunch specials just because it tasts the same with other regular chinese restaurant .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!	O O O
This is the best thing in Soho .	O O O O O O O O
Went here last night and had a pleasant experience .	O O O O O O O O O O
We parked on the block of Nina 's the place looked nice , with people obviously enjoying their pizzas .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O
I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For $ 760 for 2 people , it 's a once in a lifetime experience .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food is o.k. , but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great .	O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
I think the stuff was better than Disney .	O O O B-AS O O O O O
After reading the good reviews of this restaurant , I decided to give it a try with two friends .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While the $ 20 entree range is not overly expensive , in New York City , there is definitely better food in that range , and so Sapphire , despite it 's lovely atmosphere , will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Orsay , is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O
I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It 's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Well , their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold .	O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O
The staff is no nonsense .	O B-AS O O O O
Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Wonderful at holiday time .	O O O O O
And really large portions .	O O O B-AS O
The place is a lot of fun .	O O O O O O O O
This is a great Thai restaurant with a very friendly staff .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Have eaten at Ginger House several times , and it 's always good .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday , and I was thoroughly impressed with the food .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
I recommend the garlic shrimp , okra -LRB- bindi -RRB- , and anything with lamb .	O O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O
As a Japanese native , I 've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years , but I was just so amazed at this place .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To give you an idea of how good we thought it was , we ended up going to Ping 's three weekends in a row !!!	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As we were leaving , the couple standing by the door said to another waiter , we 're not in a hurry .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger , to steak , to escargot .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O
In fact , two people could really share one plate .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The food is great and authentic .	O B-AS O O O O O
This was a repeat visit and we 'll definitely be back again .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
during happy hour !	O O O O
Good for casual dinner with jeans and sneakers .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O

I am bringing my whole family back next time .	O O O O O O O O O O
This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O
The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
But the coconut rice was good .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O
It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O
A guaranteeed delight !	O O O O
I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Overall I would recommend it and go back again .	O O O O O O O O O O

Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list .	O O B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O B-AS B-AS I-AS O

All of my co-workers stated that the food was amazing and wondered why they had n't heard about this place .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O

However , in the summer of 2003 , it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
We wo n't go to this place again for a good meal .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
It 's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed , however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance .

I had a terrific meal , and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range , instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that was n't as good .	O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS B-AS O O O O O O

The food is good , especially their more basic dishes , and the drinks are delicious .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O
But the main hit was the whole grilled fish .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O

Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O
They do n't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O

Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
the food was undercooked-the sauce watery , and the vegetables raw .	O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sauces used are also not that exciting .	O B-AS O O O O O O O
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O
I absolutely love this place !!!	O O O O O O
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard .	O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses !	O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O
I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O
If it 's just a quick martini at the bar -LRB- which I recommend Jeffery 's -RRB- or a mind blowing Roast Chicken , go to Village !	O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
No thanks !!!	O O O
There was a long wait for a table outside , but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice .	O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O

If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O
I lOVE THIS PLACE !	O O O O O
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
So much more than the usual bar food , go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
A big disappointment , all around .	O O O O O O O

go to any corned indian restaurant , and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Given the incredible architecture surrounding it , this place has no character .	O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O
I 'd call it an ` italian dinner ' .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While the place is not a hotspot hangout , the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O

If you want to save some money , do n't go here .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The soup is pretty good too .	O B-AS O O O O O
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week 's notice .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O O
If you go to Roth 's try to be served by Mike , he is GREAT !!	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O

Went here on a friend 's reccomendation .	O O O O O O O O
not the food , not the ambiance , not the service , I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .	O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I love Ess-a-bagel , but I live on the west side , so I often go to Murray 's for convenience .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O O O

We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
Nha Trang , while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor , horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals , is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i 've ever been to . the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables .

On the other hand , if you are not fooled easily , you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse , and food that will outshine in presentaion , taste , choice , quality and quantity .

Is just the way it was in days gone by .	O O O O O O O O O O O
If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza , sorry - not the best in NYC .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
The food is amazing !!!!	O B-AS O O O
Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
The portions are now very small , the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good , the restaurant , due to its popularity , seems frantic .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For the price , you can not eat this well in Manhattan .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
The owner is very friendly and a great guy , go try his pizza , you 'll like it !	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O

It can be a very fun experience with a group , and kids -LRB- 6 and over -RRB- would love it .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With so many good restaurants on the UWS , I do n't need overpriced food , absurdly arrogant wait-staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O
I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin , which was heavenly at sushi rose .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
The bruscetta is a bit soggy , but the salads were fresh , included a nice mix of greens -LRB- not iceberg -RRB- all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O
And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful .	O O O O O O O O O O
The atmosphere is n't the greatest , but I suppose that 's how they keep the prices down .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
The pickles were great addition .	O B-AS O O O O
If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken , then this is NOT your place .	O O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
You must try the shrimp appetizers .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Filled with suits , though , so you never really feel terribly comfortable .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The production is a symphony , alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely , food portions are so tiny , two people have trouble sharing one entree .	B-AS O O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

It 's like you are transported to the Italian countryside , very romantic and filled with antiques .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Just go and see for yourself .	O O O O O O O
The restaurant was packed at first , so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Interesting selection , good wines , service fine , fun decor .	O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O B-AS O
I hate this .	O O O O
Any if you have a reservation you 'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
Whether it 's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite .	O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant !	O O O O O O
get over it !	O O O O
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like ` bar ' or ` pub ' .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O
However , it just so happens that there 's an even more amazing place just down the street .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich , Katz 's has a charm about it .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
However , looking at the table next to ours , we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza , which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
Priced at upper intermediate range .	B-AS O O O O O
The fish was adequate , but inexpertly sliced .	O B-AS O O O O O O O
I recommend ordering in on a weeknight .	O O O O O O O O
If you live in new york city , you 'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel .	O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O
While it 's not Nobu , it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

It 's very spicy but not offensive .	O O O O O O O O
they did n't disappoint , service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O
I do n't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
The rice to fish ration was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
They used shredded cheese on top !	O O B-AS I-AS O O O
They are located in the middle of Chinatown !	O O O O O O O O O

During our meal , the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks .	O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
But they do n't have a toaster , which is strange .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
So , for good food i 'd recommend it , but not for a fun night out .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O
A must for all the Dosa lovers .	O O O O O B-AS O O
The portions are HUGE , so it might be good to order three things to split -LRB- rather than one appetizer and entree per person -RRB- for two people .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
If you are a vegetarian , this really is n't a good place to go .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Try the mediterranean salad , it is a true experience for your taste buds !!	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm sure I 'll return for a final judgement tho .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Of course , it is crowded but who cares .	O O O O O O O O O O
This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

People are always friendly .	B-AS O O O O
The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee !!	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

hmmm .	O O
Service was prompt and courteous .	B-AS O O O O O
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap -LRB- undercooked -RRB- beef .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O
Chance is a small cozy restaurant , with a romantic feel to it , the decor is great .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
It was nice and fresh , but I ca n't give it high scores on being authentic thai .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Overall , worht every penny .	O O O O O O
When I called this morning , I did n't think I would be able to get in at 12 , but I was able to get in , along with four other guests .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Got club soda , filled with ice , no lime .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
Only wine and beer are served , but the house varities are actually quite good .	O B-AS O B-AS O B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build .	O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O
My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have n't been to the other locations .	O O O O O O O O O
Oh , and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough - yummy !	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average .	O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O
We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Decent wine selection too .	O B-AS I-AS O O
Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy , crowded bar at dinnertime .	O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O
I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
It 's one of our favorite places to eat in NY .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
The place does get crowded , so I recommend going between 4-5 PM .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta -LRB- raddichio was kind of bitter though -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O
Disappointing food , lousy service .	O B-AS O O B-AS O
I 'm from sichuan , this is the restaurant I recommend going .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service , this is the place .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O
great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they 're doing .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Over price , and small portions .	O B-AS O O O B-AS O
Meanwhile , the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil , gratis .	O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O
But I 'd go back	O O O O O

The food was well prepared and the service impecable .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $ 23.95 is most places , but it is $ 16 here .	O O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Good , dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch .	O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O
My husband said the portions were very small , but if my main course was good to eat the portion would 've been fine for me .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai -LRB- another delicious Thai restaurant -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Great for groups , great for a date , great for early brunch or a nightcap .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
Authentic Shanghai style and I can not recommend a better Shanghai place in New York .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese .	O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O
Perhaps the last reviewer -LRB- who stated she was treated with attitude -RRB- lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
That said , I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I 've EVER had .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everything about this restaurant was special .	O O O O O O O
Because we did n't have a reservation , we could only sit in the back garden , but it was great , secluded and perfect in nice weather .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While the food was good -LRB- certainly no Il Mulino -RRB- the service was horrendous .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
It is expensive but well worth the money .	O O O O O O O O O
Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
i would recommend reservations on weekends though .	O O O B-AS O O O O
There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is # 1 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Great pizza for lunch place .	O B-AS O O O O
The food was very expensive -LRB- we spent $ 160 for lunch for two -RRB- but extremely tasty .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
I do n't think I would go again .	O O O O O O O O O
We were a group of 8 and well seved .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O
And that 's no mean feat ...	O O O O O O O
I often go there to eat with my family .	O O O O O O O O O O
I wish they would change back to what it was before .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
The signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese .	O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
NO PIZZA 33 for me !	O O O O O O
I LOVE their spicy scallop roll , and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
I 'm no food critic , but I 'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I noted it was crossed off on the bill .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Needless to say , I 'm never going back and you should be wary too .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna .	O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O
The food was absolutely amazing !!	O B-AS O O O O
Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but , the food was slightly disappointing .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I went here with my boyfriend and another couple .	O O O O O O O O O O
The staff is also attentive and friendly .	O B-AS O O O O O O
The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish , and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O
This is definitely a place that provides the best experience , though , to both A-listers and people walking in off the street .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were such a rip-off -LRB- $ 8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns -RRB- and not worth trying .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O
first it took us a long time to find the place .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !	O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O
It is about FOOD and Ambiance , and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine .	O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food was good too .	O B-AS O O O O
We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets , and Joya is the best .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing !	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Admittedly , this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate -LRB- and thank goodness , in my opinion -RRB- but for simple , elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I am a die hard peep lover .	O O O O O O O O

Everyone treats you like you were part of the family .	O O O O O O O O O O O
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O
The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O
The menu is nothing like the one on the website .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Great food , great lay out and awesome service .	O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O
Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O

Not worth it .	O O O O
In the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , NY crowd .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car -LRB- I happen to live in Inwood -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The flavors are great , and the menu is extensive .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O
The food was amazing , the service was so attentive and personable , and how about that ambience !	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg , and will impress whoever you bring there .	O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
And forget what you read under me , the atmosphere is n't that bad either .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Do n't waste your time , or money !!	O O O O O O O O O
They do n't concern much of customer 's health , just want to make money .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We could n't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we 're taking too much time -- amazing , we just sat down .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
sometimes i get good food and ok service .	O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
We just ate at Kai and were disapointed .	O O O O O O O O O
It 's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food , noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was a great surprise .	O O O O O O
After complaining about the chicken dish , the manager came over to tell us that , no one had ever complained before , and that we just did n't know what the dish was supposed to taste like .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O

It was wonderful .	O O O O
Went for a late weekday lunch .	O O O O O B-AS O
I just do n't understand all the hype ...	O O O O O O O O O
Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Anyways , if you 're in the neighborhood to eat good food , I would n't waste my time trying to find something , rather go across the street to Tamari .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O B-AS O

Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
It 's like they took leftover chicken , poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it -LRB- the sauce was translucent and red -RRB- .	O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
One would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One of my favorite places in Manhattan .	O O O O O O O O
They brought glasses and the bottle , and just left the bottle at our table .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We actually gave 10 % tip -LRB- which we have never done despite mediocre food and service -RRB- , because we felt totally ripped off .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O

I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
While we enjoyed the food , we were highly disappointed by the poor service -LRB- waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service -RRB- and lack of remorse .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
I for one will never patronize them again .	O O O O O O O O O
I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant , and passing by it on a daily basis , we decided to try .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The service , however , was a bright flower in a garden .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
So , again , give it a try .	O O O O O O O O O
Stay far away from this place .	O O O O O O O
We will come back !!!	O O O O O
We 've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
The food is very good too but for the most part , it 's just regular food , nothing special .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it 's one of my favorite dishes .	O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
We 'd go back again	O O O O O
We ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it 's cool and the music is hear well there .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
The location is perfect .	O B-AS O O O
Guacamole + shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n't much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .	B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O

This food is asian-air fusion .	O B-AS O O O O
Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price .	O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .	B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
While I quite liked the food and the ambience , I 'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window .	O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
i 'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i 've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
But on a lazy Saturday night , we ended up going .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have never eaten in the restaurant , however , upon reading the reviews I got take out last week .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Once for dinner and once for brunch .	O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
I 've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times , it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not worth the prices .	O O O B-AS O
Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective !	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

On a recent Sunday afternoon , a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The service is a bit slow , but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli , Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O
Either that , or the editor 's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I love this place !	O O O O O
it is not consistent .	O O O O O

At 5 dumplings for $ 1 , you just can not go wrong .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O

And the staff is also young , energeic and hot !!!!	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Even better , they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O

It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O

at night , but it 's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
It just was n't Thai .	O O O O O O
I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O

But they 've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza -LRB- a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual -RRB- .

The steak is good , the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O
For asian fusion , there are many places further downtown .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Old school meets New world .	O O O O O O
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
The service was poor , restaurant poorly lit , staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald 's than this joint .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This is probably one of my new favorite places .	O O O O O O O O O O
For being number 1 , this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion , I do prefer smaller , quiter restaurants .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They all know you .	O O O O O
My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails , the chill decor , and the decent sushi .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O

The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past .	O B-AS I-AS O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
Everytime my husband and I go there , we are never disappointed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are the best bagels I 've had .	O O O O B-AS O O O O
We were not disappointed .	O O O O O
I 've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O
Toons has recently been redone , so it 's now a very attractive space .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but , that 's just it -- the PAST !	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , I think this place is a good hang out spot .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The menu is Prix Fixe , so be prepared to spend at least $ 60 per person , but it is Well worth itsuperb food .	O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

The specials are usually quite good too .	O B-AS O O O O O O
They 've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods .	O O O O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O
Try the chocolate mud cake -LRB- warmed -RRB- with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato .	O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
That 's good and bad .	O O O O O O

Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere -LRB- Anywhere -RRB- .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
Only drawback - they wo n't toast your bagel , and they do n't make eggs for the bagel .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O

Service was very good and warm .	B-AS O O O O O O
For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan .	O B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really ca n't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O
Like others have said , do n't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes , a busy restaurant may require you to wait .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Seriously , this place kicks ass .	O O O O O O O
Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went .	B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food is nothing like its menu description .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Try the Pad Se-Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience .	O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
It 's just O.K. pizza .	O O O O B-AS O

THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The service was a bit slow , but they were very friendly .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O

Nice place though .	O O O O
Warning : You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similar to other Indian restaurants , they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet - go late and it will be packed !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The people with carts of food do n't understand you because they do n't speak English , their job is to give you the delicious food you point at .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
The crackling calamari salad , which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants , is crispy and lightly dressed .	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not the greatest sushi place , but excellent for a $ 19.95 all you can eat .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here : simple contract , deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20 .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy !	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O
We 've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we 've been lucky ?	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Drinks way over priced .	B-AS O O B-AS O
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
What I did n't like was how the food came right after it was ordered .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
But WARNING : to all those that use this site be weary , be very weary of recommendations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moderate prices .	O B-AS O

If we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager -LRB- a bubbly , friendly young woman with a great smile -RRB- truly cared about how we were doing .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ok , for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC , we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants , most of which stay open very late .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had .	O O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O
I would highly recommend it .	O O O O O O
It 's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O

Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic ...	O O O O O O O O O O O O O

the real kicker of the menu , however , is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
It was good , but was not what I thought it would be .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The plain slice is great and if you get toppings , the whole slice is topped with them , not sparsely sprinkled on like some places .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .	B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
Service is great , takeout is good too .	B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O
Based on the reviews on here , it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The pizza is overpriced and soggy .	O B-AS O O O O O
Everything is excellent , the menu is quite extensive , and you eat with a view on both sides of the city .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
You 'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city , and most still do n't compare .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For the quality of food , a little too expensive .	O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O
Came looking for this place because I heard good things .	O O O O O O O O O O O
I live on the street this place is on .	O O O O O O O O O O
Horrible .	O O
Here 's to the fake fish tanks too ...	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O
Its worth the wait though .	O O O B-AS O O
I 've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .	O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O
The first time I went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
What an amazing meal and experience !	O O O B-AS O O O
Unique apppetizers .	O B-AS O
The staff has always been attentive and kind , and I 've always been amazed at how they 've handled all the various different group sizes that come in .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
Nothing special about this place .	O O O O O O
Also , the sandwiches -LRB- nearing $ 7 -RRB- did n't come with anything like chips or a side .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
and never strayed .	O O O O
The wait here is long for dim sum , but if you do n't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig , this is a sleek -LRB- for Chinatown -RRB- alternative .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Leave the kids at home !	O O O O O O
This place has good potential , but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
Everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O
And all of that wo n't break your bank !	O O O O O O O O O O
The Thai food is good .	O B-AS I-AS O O O
Just moved to the neighborhood and we 've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As I made the title , it 's an affordable restaurant for great taste .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
They even scoop it out nice -LRB- for those on a diet -RRB- not too much not to little .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Definitely not worth the price !	O O O O B-AS O
Orsay , is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food , and French service as well .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O
It 's easy to get a table for a large group and you do n't get hustled out .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
Great food at reasonable prices .	O B-AS O O B-AS O
Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .	B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef , and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O O O O
That 's why you have to pay more for that .	O O O O O O O O O O O
If you 've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
I loved it .	O O O O
They 're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing , Queens .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The prices are about $ 9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O B-AS O
and you ca n't beat the prices .	O O O O O O B-AS O
but I would n't wan na live there .	O O O O O O O O O
Arigato Gozimas Yuka !	O O O O
Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
I had the black cod with yuzu sauce , which was wonderful .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip .	O O O O O O O O O O O
I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I would highly recommend this place !	O O O O O O O
Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot .	O O O O O O O B-AS O
Yes , there might be a wait if you have no reservations .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O
Thank You Emilio .	O O O O
First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks .	O O O O O O O
Everything , from the soft bread , soggy salad , and 50 minute wait time , with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food .	O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O
- i asked for them spicy and they were delicious -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is terrific , as is the value .	O O O O O O O O O
The sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great !	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction	B-AS I-AS O O O O O
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O
The food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over-bearing or rushed .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
-LRB- food was delivered by a busboy , not waiter -RRB- We got no cheese offered for the pasta , our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal , when we would have easily spent another $ 20 on wine .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food was not fresh , the sauces were bland and very oily .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Off the beaten path , this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
This is definitely an excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the night scene is more than alive .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One of us actually liked the expresso - that 's it .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
Everyone was more then happy with his choices .	O O O O O O O O O
Again , the waitress was awesome .	O O O B-AS O O O
Worth the trip from Manhattan .	O O O O O O
I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors .	O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O
The food was just OK , I would never go back .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
Zero ambiance to boot .	O B-AS O O O
Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O
i recommend the thai popcorn : -RRB-	O O O B-AS I-AS O O
I ca n't wait for the nex time .	O O O O O O O O O
Everything looks great , the drinks , the decor , the food , even the people .	O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O
The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed .	O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Great neighborhood joint .	O O O O
The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .	O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O O O
The only disappointment was the coat check girls who did n't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night -LRB- for the coat check girls -RRB- .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O
My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I could n't believe the food .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

I take all my NYC guests to VT 's .	O O O O O O O O O O
It is sometimes a little cramped , and can get a little warm , but hello , it 's NYC !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We had great desserts -LRB- including the best cannoli I 've ever had -RRB- and then they offered an after dinner drink , on the house .	O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
Good crowd , good outdoor seating , with a hip japanese vibe .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O
Even with the prix fixe pricing , this restaurant is not worth it .	O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
We asked to be moved -LRB- which took half an hour -RRB- , and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back , even though the rest of the room was practically empty .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off , like in this case .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , their popularity has yet to slow down , and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters , the tanks at Ping 's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover 's brunch .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O
The Halibut was too salty , dessert was so so -LRB- do n't waste any of your calories -RRB- and service was poor .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
The view is spectacular , and the food is great .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O
The place was n't too hard to find , but it was kind of packed , as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food , the line reached the door .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Good bagels and good cream cheese .	O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O
The food is wonderful , tasty and filling , and the service is professional and friendly .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
It is also extremely well priced .	O O O O O B-AS O
Always great service !	O O B-AS O
I am happy i did the food was awsome .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O
I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth 's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We ordered the chicken casserole , but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken , all dark meat and on the bone .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O
A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
I went to DF for Valentines Day dinner .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
I recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .	O O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
I LOVED THE SHOWS .	O O O B-AS O
and i have been around the block , to say the very least .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu .	O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O
The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge .	O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O
Then , get ripped on free box wine .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
If you do n't mind pre-sliced low quality fish , unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O
As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats , except at Taj Mahal .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Also , do n't plan on asking for your favorite roll , if it 's not on the menu , you ca n't have it .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Give it a try and enjoy .	O O O O O O O
Good food .	O B-AS O
... and that 's saying a lot .	O O O O O O O O
those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n't fresh .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
The pesto pizza was excellent , thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I 'd never heard of before .	O B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
if your into thai . . you can not miss this great restaurant .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Going to Ballato 's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen , an absolute delight !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
try the spicy shrimp appetizer -LRB- again , not the greatest value in the world but worth the price -RRB- and the lamb vindaloo is great .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O
However , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !	O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit	B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong , it actually means Great Prosperity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I think the restaurant was too loud -LRB- when full -RRB- to be romantic .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I have had so many dinners here and it 's always been perfect - on a date with my husband , with my mom , with girlfriends and larger groups .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When you want a piece of beef , head on over .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
Delicate spices , onions , eggs and a kick-ass roti .	O B-AS O B-AS O B-AS O O O B-AS O
Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this , but the second visit was even worse .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Also , if you do n't want to sit at a certain table , you do n't have to !	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Unbelievable .	O O
A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The menu has lots of options : I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
The staff is n't the friendliest or most competent , and I am stickler for service , but everything else about this place makes up for it .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them , as they tend to offer large portions .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
This restaurant was way overhyped .	O O O O O O
I 've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I 've been sitting there while he lectured another customer .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
Delicious crab cakes too .	O B-AS I-AS O O
Now at the top of our list , Del Frisco 's Steakhouse .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
This was the worst dining experience I 've ever had .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O
Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
I thought I had died and gone to heaven .	O O O O O O O O O O
Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again , I will certainly stop by .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The bruschetta and panini 's are so yummy !	O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O
Food was okay , nothing great .	B-AS O O O O O O
Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
I have been going there since it opened and I ca n't get enough .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Always popular , always full , always a wait .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O
In fact , you ca n't miss it .	O O O O O O O O O
I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
A little noise but I think that was because of our party !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety , serving almost 40 % of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
I ca n't wait for summer , when they serve outside on their gigantic patio .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O

go here for the drinks !	O O O O B-AS O
I do n't get it , what 's so special about Prune ?	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'd definitely recommend this little place .	O O O O O O O O
Again , if you are in this neighborhood - by all means , come here .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first 2 courses were very good , but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
Butter was melted , white wine warm , cheese oozing everywhere .	B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O O
We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe 's to eat here .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It can not be the ambience , because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle .	O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course -LRB- other restaurants offer 3 choices -RRB- and ended up ordering a la carte .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
Authentic Pakistani food .	O B-AS I-AS O

Get it together .	O O O O
The eggplant parmesan is also great , and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
Quality ingredients preparation all around , and a very fair price for NYC .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Service was very good - prompt , attentive and non-intrusive .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid , and was unnecessarily heated with a burner .	O B-AS O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
We began with the cheese fondue -LRB- the artisanal blend -RRB- and added apples and kielbasa to dip .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O
In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch , this place is great .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O
Its not curry in a slurry crap , and regular run of the mill food .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
In fact , while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu , and I could n't help telling them that the food was horrible .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Even though the restaurant was packed , we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery , generic white sauce , this is your place .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
The bread is the soft paratha bread -LRB- unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta -RRB- , and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful .	O B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O
Service is friendly , prices are good - delivery time was a little slow , but for the way this pizza tastes , I 'm willing to overlook it .	B-AS O O O B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n't like .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O

The food however , is what one might expect .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O

I must give it Yon out of Yon stars !	O O O O O O O O O O
The pizza was really good .	O B-AS O O O O
The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting , the additional menu items are only written in Chinese .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
Food is average , and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi 's tastes better .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .	O B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O

I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners , which is not good considering the bill was nearly $ 100 .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
I choose to go with one of the special , the braised lamb shank in red wine , which was excellent .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines , please check their wine list .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O

Have the iced tea .	O O B-AS I-AS O

The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
They are FAST .	O O O O
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O
The food is very good for it 's price , better than most fried dumplings I 've had .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O

Very neighborhoody , very quick and sufficient .	O O O O O O O O
Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys .	B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Everything is delicious , though , my gf and I come here once a week sometimes - you will get addicted !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
And I could do without the cigar smoke .	O O O O O O O O O
Still , try it once , since if you end up loving the food , it could be one of your best dining experiences .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
I 've waited over one hour for food .	O O O O O O O B-AS O

The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I 've had at this price range .	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit .	B-AS O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
The place is a BISTRO which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS B-AS O O O O B-AS O
This is one of the best comfort food places in the city .	O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
Overall , the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves .	O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room -LRB- no matter what the size of your party -RRB- , the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters - you 'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you 're in .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
Considering their price of $ 6.25 for lunch special , the dish was ridiculously small .	O O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O O O
This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food -LRB- all fast foods in my opinion -RRB- .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
Besides , when you have bad service , that 's less money you have to tip .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore .	O O O O O O O O O O O O

I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

As a retired hipster , I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more .	O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Then , IF they answer the phone , you 're lucky if they do n't hang up on you !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you .	O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O

Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place , and are not in a rush , this place is a bad idea .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
You have to increase the service a lot .	O O O O O B-AS O O O
Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries .	B-AS O O O O B-AS O O
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small -LRB- especially the appetizers -RRB- , so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef 's special tasting menu , prepare to order and pay for an appetizer -LRB- 1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing -RRB- , a main entree , and the cold udon at the end of the meal .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O
After we got our sashimi order , I could not believe how small the portions were !	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
After the main course came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES !	O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O

I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Service is extraordinary , yet not overbearing , and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
The dosas are skimpy , unattractive and drip with grease , and personally I 'd drink popcorn topping before I 'd eat another one of these .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
The service was excellent and the food was delicious .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O

The food was very good , but not very thai .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you , but the food does n't quite match up .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends , having lunch , dinner , pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks !	O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
This is a fun restaurant to go to .	O O O O O O O O O
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it , they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O

Their sake martini is wonderful .	O B-AS I-AS O O O

I know this is the case in many nyc eateries , but here , they really cram you in to the point where it 's borderline uncomfortable .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Overall a disappointing experience for that price category .	O O O O O O B-AS O O

I have been to Rao 's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
-LRB- and I have eaten my share -RRB- Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Sure , the setting is nice .	O O O B-AS O O O
Overall a worthwhile experience .	O O O O O
The service is friendly , if not the most prompt in the world , the food is great , and the prices , while not cheap , wo n't put your wallet out of commission .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their whitefish salad is excellent -- all whitefish with a little mayo .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O
And it all comes at a very reasonable price -LRB- congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3-6 each -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end , not one person takes responsibility for anything .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I had a great experience .	O O O O O O
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry , inedible chicken with terrible sauce .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience , but for superb food at reasonable prices , La Villa ca n't be beat .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Wo n't or Ca n't is not in the service directory .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O

I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
To speak of the Park Side , words can not describe .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
The red curry is weak and tasteless , the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy , the rice is often overcooked , and the seafood is pretty sketchy .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS B-AS O
Saul is pretty good , but definitely not great .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O
I would recommend Roxy 's for that , but not for their food .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
We always get a sampling of appetizers and share .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Overall I was impressed and will return , it 's a great QPR -LRB- Quality to Price Ratio -RRB- .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O
It is nearly impossible to get a table , so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner , DO NOT pass it up .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O

I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent !!	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city -LRB- Seattle -RRB- , we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant .

Suan is a great place that I often take my friends -LRB- classmates -RRB- too .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Not a great place for family or general dining .	O O O O O O O O O O
As for the bar , this is another bad idea .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
Their bagels are fine , but they are a little overcooked , and not really a ` special ' bagel experience .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O
Unlike HH up the block , this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O

The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese -LRB- gets a little messy -RRB- .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O

No plans to return anytime soon .	O O O O O O O

I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

As far as the service goes , the waitresses were not particularly friendly , but they got the job done .	O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place , but also become hostile !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O

Perhaps it was an off night , but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Plus they made a perfect martini .	O O O O O B-AS O
I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 've eaten thai many times , and am very familiar with the cuisine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O

The tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .	O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
All in all a wonderful experience , ca n't wait to come back .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing .	O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O
It was a very nice surprise .	O O O O O O O
Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
The staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O

I 've dined at Alain Ducasse 's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O

But trust me it is so worth it .	O O O O O O O O O
It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
THe perfect spot .	O O O O
The only weird thing was if we got a bottle , the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4 , which makes no sense whatsoever .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
They sell special sushi , everything have a topping , sauce and etc. .	O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O O
DO not try unless you 're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
They never came back to refill our glasses again .	O O O O O O O O O O
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it 's great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it , but they were not !	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They 're rude at times , and not very friendly .	O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O

Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt 's house for dinner , assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
The sushi has been from average to below average , the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating -LRB- if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen , the acousitcs are horrid , everything echoes is extremely loud -RRB- .

Very good value	O O O
Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O

Overall , the best bagel in town .	O O O O B-AS O O O
Everything a NY pizza joint should be .	O O O O O O O O
It was huge , delicious , fresh , and will be the reason we return .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We go often .	O O O O
Light , refreshing summer rolls -LRB- not fried -RRB- remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris .	O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O
moral stay away .	O O O O
but the service was a bit slow .	O O B-AS O O O O O
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey .	B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O
When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli , I knew there was going to be good pizza !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
Indoor was very cozy and cute .	B-AS O O O O O O
We had a 3 hour brunch - they definitely do not rush you - and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service !	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O B-AS O
They 're terrific !!	O O O O

I 've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I 've been going .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
Food is excellent .	B-AS O O O
This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers , right off of Pell St -LRB- barber 's alley -RRB- in Chinatown .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They outshine HH .	O O O O
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .	O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O
Excellent lunch buffet for only $ 6.95 .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O

If you 're not familiar with the cuisine , you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they do n't accept credit cards .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
both are very reasonably priced -LRB- around $ 8 for dinner and $ 5 for lunch -RRB- , and are delicious and filling .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable .	O O O O O O O O O
Ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .	B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The portion sizes here are huge , and the sushi is good .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Just wish they 'd expand .	O O O O O O
My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly !	O O O B-AS O O O O O O
This was n't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup , but I thought that was what made the place so special .	O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Good food at the restaurant -LRB- a bit expensive , but great if you want to impress your date -RRB- .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
You ca n't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
I have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
keep up the good work .	O O O O O O
I was n't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but I guess that 's the price you pay for a popular place .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
great eats , good times .	O B-AS O O O O
Make sure you try this place as often as you can .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Grilled whole fish wonderful , great spicing .	O O B-AS O O O O O
For years , I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best , but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
Plus , when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night , the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over !	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
The service was great as well .	O B-AS O O O O O
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .	O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O
I will go back to Suan soon !	O O O O O O O O
Loved it !	O O O
The food was delicious , the atmosphere was relaxed , and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second !	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We were pleasantly surprised .	O O O O O
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
It is LOUD , HOT and DARK .	O O O O O O O O
I found the food , service and value exceptional everytime I have been there .	O O O B-AS O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The food is definitely good , but I left a bit disappointed .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
I am a 100 lb girl , had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner , and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place !	O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The drinks are a saving grace , but service staff , please , get over yourselves .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O
It was wonderful .	O O O O
There is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O
Will give it another chance before I write it off .	O O O O O O O O O O O
The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start .	O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
The prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O
If you go here - your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The filet mignon dish was superb !	O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O
I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O
Ca n't wait wait for my next visit .	O O O O O O O O O
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
The food is good , I ca n't lie .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O
great food , lt 's of it , more then one person can eat !	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I did n't expect to like Nosh as much as I did , but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly , the soups are like Mom 's , and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel 's a run for its money .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O
The atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most .	O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O
This place is worth going even if only for their beer .	O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi -LRB- on saffron risotto - yum ! -RRB- .	O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O
The ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers , no matter what the reviews say .	O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
The sandwhiches are out-of-this world !	O B-AS O O O O
If you live in Upper Manhattan , Siam Square is THE place for Thia food .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O
Decor is charming .	B-AS O O O
The food was very well prepared .	O B-AS O O O O O
Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though .	O O B-AS I-AS O B-AS O O O B-AS O O
Stay away from this place .	O O O O O O
Good , because hey , it 's more food , but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap .	O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O
While most people can attest to spending over $ 50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing , the drinks here are plentiful and unique .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Complimentary stuff kept coming , and when the waiter saw me opening a gift , I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it , with a candlevery nice touch , and attentive staff .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called , cold and soggy .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O
If you go for the pre-theatre menu , it 's an even greater deal .	O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O
The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you , brother ?	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Brava La Pizza Fresca !	O O O O O
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity , elegance , and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size , Kai is your place .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
The prices can not be beat for the quality , quantity , freshness and taste .	O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS O B-AS O B-AS O
Check it out , it wo n't hurt your stomach or your wallet .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
If just to drop in , quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Little Tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had !	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES .	O O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O
I go back in line like three times on average until I ca n't walk anymore .	O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O
We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty .	O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O
Horrible food and Horrible service .	O B-AS O O B-AS O
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and ca n't wait to try the fondue or table grilling .	O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O
Bleecker St Pizza is the best !	O O O O O O O
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY .	O O O O O O O O
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu .	O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS I-AS O
THE BIG COMPLAINT : NO TOASTING AVAILABLE .	O O O O O B-AS O O
Even if the food was n't this good , the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O B-AS O O O B-AS O O O O O O
Volare virgins or weekly regulars , everyone gets treated the same and you ca n't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O
The food came out wrong , the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal .	O B-AS O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O B-AS O
The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection , and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites .	O B-AS O B-AS O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O
Faan is sooo good .	O O O O O
We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I 'm not sure which dim sum dish it was .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O
No you 're going to go back because the food was good .	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
The food was great and the service was even better .	O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O
While this can hardly be called a restaurant , it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten : $ 4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .	B-AS I-AS I-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef -LRB- usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt -RRB- .	O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O B-AS O B-AS I-AS O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O
Consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ` nt feel like finishing them .	O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !	O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O

We will be back .	O O O O O
We were seated and ignored by waitstaff .	O O O O O O B-AS O
If you are in a big group , this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS I-AS O O B-AS O O O O O O O O
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt .	O O O O O O O B-AS O O

I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I 'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O B-AS O
The burger was great , also .	O B-AS O O O O O
they did give a 15 % discount at the end , was n't enough , as they knew the service was horrible .	O O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O
Just because it 's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , IT IS GREAT !	O O O O O O O O O B-AS O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O
The pizza was great .	O B-AS O O O
And everytime I go there 's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty -LRB- could 've used a bit more salt -RRB- .	O O O O B-AS I-AS O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
however , it 's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .	O O O O O B-AS O O O O O O O O O
